# Stock Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to compile all stocks listed as revelant and their performance during 2017 and 2018. This should help give a concentrated view and make deciding where to invest a bit easier based on trends presented in the data.

## Results

As we can see from the excel images, Total Daily Volume for almost all stocks included in our data set was way down in 2018 compared to 2017. We can also see that run time for the refactored code was much faster than the original run time. This is due to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) technique that refactoring code offers. 

## Summary

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code? Refactoring code helps save time for both the coder and the code employed. By concantanating and simplifying code we cut down on mistakes and unneccessary conditionals. If I had to think of a disadvantage, it may take away from a deeper understanding of the code. And if changes aren't properly documented in the code by using ' then all the steps taken may not be known or understood by future coders.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? Taking notes in the code to map out the steps and then seeing where changes needed to be made was much easier when refactoring versus writing the initial code.
